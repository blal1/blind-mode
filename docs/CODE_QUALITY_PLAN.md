## Overview

**Goal:** Improve maintainability, readability, efficiency, and documentation while reducing technical debt.

**Approach:** Incremental stages, risky/fundamental changes first, each stage independently testable.

**Key Decisions:**
- Keep `old/` folders as archive (move removed code there)
- Central debug toggle (single global flag)
- Extract utilities only from large files (don't split navigators)
- High priority on unifying panel detection and dropdown flags

---

## Phase 1: Inspection & Cleanup (LOW RISK) - COMPLETE

### Stage 1.1: Root Directory Cleanup - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Remove clutter from root directory

**Completed:**
- Created `archive/analysis/` folder
- Moved 9 `analysis_*.txt` files (~1.5MB) to archive
- Created `archive/backups/` folder
- Moved 3 "working back up" folders (~26MB) to archive
- Removed `nul` file (Windows artifact)
- Removed garbage file from failed command
- Kept German-named files (user preference)

---

## Phase 2: Debug Infrastructure (MEDIUM RISK, FUNDAMENTAL) - PARTIAL

### Stage 2.1: Create Global Debug Configuration - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Create centralized debug toggle system

**Completed:**
- Created `src/Core/Services/DebugConfig.cs` with:
  - `DebugEnabled` master toggle (default: false)
  - Category toggles: LogNavigation, LogPanelDetection, LogFocusTracking, LogCardInfo, LogActivation, LogAnnouncements, LogPatches
  - `Log(tag, message)` and `LogIf(category, tag, message)` methods
  - `EnableAll()` / `DisableAll()` convenience methods

---

### Stage 2.2: Migrate UIFocusTracker Debug Code - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Replace hardcoded `_debugMode = true` with DebugConfig

**Completed:**
- Removed `_debugMode` field and `LOG_PREFIX` constant
- Updated `Update()` to use `DebugConfig.DebugEnabled && DebugConfig.LogFocusTracking`
- Replaced `Log()` method to use `DebugConfig.LogIf`
- Replaced 12 direct `MelonLogger.Msg` calls with `DebugConfig.LogIf`
- Kept `MelonLogger.Warning` for errors (always visible)

---

### Stage 2.3: Migrate High-Volume Logging Files - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Update top 5 files by MelonLogger.Msg call count

**Completed:**
1. **CardModelProvider.cs** (123 calls) → `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogCardInfo, ...)`
2. **PanelStatePatch.cs** (85 calls) → `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogPatches, ...)`
   - Added `using AccessibleArena.Core.Services;`
3. **MenuDebugHelper.cs** (58 calls) → `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogNavigation, tag, ...)`
   - Preserved dynamic `tag` parameter for caller-specified tags
4. **DuelAnnouncer.cs** (51 calls) → `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogAnnouncements, ...)`
5. **PlayerPortraitNavigator.cs** (53 calls) → `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogNavigation, ...)`

**Total:** 370 MelonLogger.Msg calls migrated to DebugConfig.LogIf

**Key Changes:**
- All debug logging now respects `DebugConfig.DebugEnabled` toggle
- MelonLogger.Warning/Error calls preserved (always visible)
- Category-specific toggles allow fine-grained control

**Testing:** Verified in duel - all tags appearing correctly with DebugEnabled=true

**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Dependencies:** Stage 2.1

---

## Phase 3: Code Deduplication (LOW RISK) - COMPLETE

### Stage 3.1: Consolidate GetGameObjectPath - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Remove 4 duplicate implementations, use MenuDebugHelper as single source

**Completed:**
- Kept `MenuDebugHelper.GetGameObjectPath()` as single source
- Removed duplicates from:
  - `UIFocusTracker.cs` (also removed MAX_HIERARCHY_DEPTH constant)
  - `DuelNavigator.cs`
  - `DuelAnnouncer.cs`
- `GeneralMenuNavigator.cs` already had thin wrapper (OK)

---

### Stage 3.2: Consolidate Log() Wrapper Methods - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Remove duplicate Log() implementations

**Completed:**
- Updated `UIActivator.cs` Log() to use `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogActivation, ...)`
- Updated `NPERewardNavigator.cs` Log() to use `DebugConfig.LogIf(LogNavigation, ...)`
- `UIFocusTracker.cs` already updated in Stage 2.2

**Tested:** Debug logging verified working with `DebugEnabled = true`

---

### Stage 3.3: Remove Commented Deprecated Code - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Clean up commented-out deprecated setters

**Completed:**
- Removed SetTargetNavigator comment from `BattlefieldNavigator.cs`
- Removed SetTargetNavigator + SetDiscardNavigator comments from `ZoneNavigator.cs`
- Removed SetTargetNavigator comment from `DuelAnnouncer.cs`
- ~20 lines of dead code removed

---

## Phase 4: Dropdown Flag Unification (HIGH PRIORITY, HIGH RISK) - NEXT

### Stage 4.1: Document Dropdown Flag Behavior (Exploration) - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Analysis only - map current behavior

**Current flags (4 total):**
- `BaseNavigator._wasInDropdownMode`
- `BaseNavigator._skipDropdownModeTracking`
- `UIFocusTracker._suppressNextFocusAnnouncement`
- `UIFocusTracker._suppressDropdownModeEntry`

**Completed:**
- Created `docs/DROPDOWN_HANDLING.md` documenting:
  - All 4 flags with their purposes, set/clear conditions, and locations
  - Additional state variables (`_dropdownEditMode`, `_activeDropdownObject`)
  - 3 state machine diagrams (normal flow, auto-advance, auto-open suppression)
  - Redundancy analysis: parallel suppression mechanisms
  - Recommendations for Stage 4.2 (unified DropdownStateManager)
  - Test scenarios for implementation phase

**Key Finding:**
- Two flags (`_skipDropdownModeTracking` and `_suppressDropdownModeEntry`) serve similar purposes
- Root cause: dual state tracking in BaseNavigator and UIFocusTracker
- Recommended approach for 4.2: unified DropdownStateManager

**Risk:** NONE (exploration only)

---

### Stage 4.2: Implement Unified Dropdown State - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Consolidate 4 flags into single source of truth

**Completed:**
1. Created `src/Core/Services/DropdownStateManager.cs`:
   - Single source of truth for all dropdown state
   - `_wasInDropdownMode` - exit transition detection
   - `_suppressReentry` - unified suppression mechanism
   - `_activeDropdownObject` - active dropdown reference
   - Public API: `IsInDropdownMode`, `UpdateAndCheckExitTransition()`, `OnDropdownOpened()`, `OnDropdownClosed()`, `SuppressReentry()`
2. Updated `BaseNavigator.cs`:
   - Removed `_wasInDropdownMode` and `_skipDropdownModeTracking` flags
   - HandleInput() uses `DropdownStateManager.UpdateAndCheckExitTransition()`
   - CloseActiveDropdown() uses `DropdownStateManager.OnDropdownClosed()`
   - CloseDropdownOnElement() uses `DropdownStateManager.SuppressReentry()`
3. Updated `UIFocusTracker.cs`:
   - Removed `_dropdownEditMode`, `_activeDropdownObject`, `_suppressDropdownModeEntry`
   - `EnterDropdownEditMode()` delegates to DropdownStateManager
   - `ExitDropdownEditMode()` delegates to DropdownStateManager
   - Simplified `HandleFocusChange()` - no longer tracks dropdown state
4. Updated `docs/DROPDOWN_HANDLING.md` with new architecture

**Key Changes:**
- 4 flags consolidated to 1 suppression flag in DropdownStateManager
- Single API for all dropdown state operations
- Clear separation: DropdownStateManager owns state, UIFocusTracker queries dropdown IsExpanded

**Testing:** Build succeeds. Runtime testing recommended for:
- Dropdown navigation works (arrow keys)
- Escape/Backspace closes dropdown
- No double announcements
- Auto-advance after selection (Month -> Day -> Year)

**Risk:** HIGH (complex state machine)

**Dependencies:** Stage 4.1

---

## Phase 5: Panel Detection Cleanup (MEDIUM RISK)

### Stage 5.1: Document Panel Detection Strategy (Exploration) - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Create authoritative documentation

**Current methods (4):**
1. Harmony patches (event-driven) - `HarmonyPanelDetector.cs`
2. Reflection polling (IsOpen) - `ReflectionPanelDetector.cs`
3. Alpha detection (CanvasGroup) - `AlphaPanelDetector.cs`
4. Direct GameObject search - various navigators

**Completed:**
- Updated `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` "Panel Detection Strategy" section with:
  - Architecture overview with ASCII diagram showing PanelStateManager as central coordinator
  - Three detector descriptions (Harmony, Reflection, Alpha) with file locations
  - Panel → Detector mapping table showing which detector handles which panels
  - Detailed "Detector Ownership" section with exhaustive pattern lists
  - Updated decision tree for adding new panels
  - Updated "Adding a New Panel" steps with correct file paths
  - Added "Legacy Files" note about MenuPanelTracker and UnifiedPanelDetector

**Key Findings:**
- PanelStateManager is the single source of truth (created in AccessibleArenaMod.cs)
- Each detector has explicit `HandlesPanel()` method with exclusion logic
- ReflectionDetector explicitly excludes Harmony and Alpha patterns
- Legacy files (MenuPanelTracker, UnifiedPanelDetector) still exist but are supplementary

**Risk:** NONE

---

### Stage 5.2: Audit Panel Detection Overlaps - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Identify panels detected by multiple methods

**Completed:**
1. Added `LogPanelOverlapDiagnostic` flag to DebugConfig.cs
2. Added runtime overlap tracking to PanelStateManager:
   - `_panelDetectorAudit` dictionary tracks which detector first reports each panel
   - `_overlapAudit` dictionary tracks all detectors that try to report each panel
   - `TrackPanelDetectorAudit()` logs warnings when overlap detected
   - `DumpOverlapAudit()` dumps full audit results to log
3. Added static analysis method `RunStaticOverlapAnalysis()`:
   - Tests 25+ known panel names against all three detectors' `HandlesPanel()` methods
   - Identifies panels claimed by multiple detectors
   - Identifies unclaimed panels
   - Shows ownership summary by detector

**How to Use:**
1. Enable diagnostic mode: Set `DebugConfig.DebugEnabled = true` and `DebugConfig.LogPanelOverlapDiagnostic = true`
2. Run game through screens - overlaps logged as warnings in real-time
3. Call `PanelStateManager.Instance.DumpOverlapAudit()` for full report
4. Call `PanelStateManager.Instance.RunStaticOverlapAnalysis()` for static analysis

**Key Finding (Static Analysis):**
The current HandlesPanel() implementations appear to have proper mutual exclusion:
- HarmonyDetector has explicit patterns (playblade, settings, socialui, etc.)
- ReflectionDetector explicitly excludes Harmony and Alpha patterns in HandlesPanel()
- AlphaDetector only claims its specific patterns (systemmessageview, dialog, modal, etc.)

**Testing:** Build succeeds, audit tools ready for runtime testing

**Risk:** LOW (diagnostic only)

**Dependencies:** Stage 5.1

---

### Stage 5.3: Eliminate Panel Detection Overlaps - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Ensure each panel detected by exactly one method

**Completed:**
1. Added `OwnedPatterns` static arrays to HarmonyPanelDetector and AlphaPanelDetector
2. Added comprehensive ownership comments (Panel Ownership regions) to all three detectors:
   - HarmonyPanelDetector: Documents why Harmony (patchable methods, slide animations)
   - AlphaPanelDetector: Documents why Alpha (fade in/out, no IsOpen property)
   - ReflectionPanelDetector: Documents fallback role and explicit exclusions
3. Updated exclusion logic:
   - AlphaPanelDetector now defensively excludes HarmonyPanelDetector.OwnedPatterns
   - ReflectionPanelDetector now references OwnedPatterns from other detectors (DRY)
4. Updated `RunStaticOverlapAnalysis()` to use OwnedPatterns arrays instead of hardcoded values

**Key Changes:**
- `HarmonyPanelDetector.OwnedPatterns` - authoritative list for event-driven panels
- `AlphaPanelDetector.OwnedPatterns` - authoritative list for alpha-fade panels
- All detectors now have clear `#region Panel Ownership` documentation
- Mutual exclusion is enforced by referencing other detectors' OwnedPatterns

**Testing:** Build succeeds. Runtime testing recommended for:
- Each panel announced exactly once
- No missing detections
- Settings menu works in all scenes

**Risk:** MEDIUM

**Dependencies:** Stage 5.2

---

## Phase 6: Utility Extraction from Large Files (LOW RISK)

### Stage 6.1: Extract Shared Utilities from BaseNavigator - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Move utility methods to appropriate service classes

**File:** `src/Core/Services/BaseNavigator.cs` (76K → ~74K after extraction)

**Completed:**
1. **Moved `GetCharacterName(char)` to `Strings.cs`**
   - Pure utility mapping characters to speakable names (space, dot, comma, etc.)
   - 47-line method relocated to Strings.cs where character constants already exist
   - Enables reuse by other components needing character announcements

2. **Moved `GetInputFieldLabel(GameObject)` to `UITextExtractor.cs`**
   - Extracts readable labels from input field names and placeholders
   - Patterns: "Input Field - Email" → "Email", "InputField_Username" → "Username"
   - Falls back to placeholder text, then cleaned object name
   - Now public method available for other navigators

**Changes:**
- `BaseNavigator.cs`: Removed 2 methods (~80 lines), updated 4 call sites to use utilities
- `Strings.cs`: Added `GetCharacterName(char)` method
- `UITextExtractor.cs`: Added `GetInputFieldLabel(GameObject)` method

**Testing:** Build succeeds with 0 warnings, 0 errors

**Risk:** LOW

---

### Stage 6.2: Extract Shared Utilities from UIActivator - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Move utility methods to MenuDebugHelper or new class

**File:** `src/Core/Services/UIActivator.cs` (101K → ~100K after deduplication)

**Completed:**
1. **Removed duplicate `FormatFieldValue()` method (~25 lines)**
   - Functionality was identical to `MenuDebugHelper.FormatValueForLog()`
   - Updated 4 call sites to use the shared method
   - Made `FormatValueForLog()` public in MenuDebugHelper

**Not extracted (rationale):**
- `InspectUnityEvent()` and `InspectDelegate()` - Only used within UIActivator's debug methods
- Type detection methods (`IsCustomButton`, `HasClickHandler`, etc.) - Tightly coupled to activation logic

**Changes:**
- `UIActivator.cs`: Removed `FormatFieldValue()`, updated 4 debug call sites
- `MenuDebugHelper.cs`: Made `FormatValueForLog()` public

**Testing:** Build succeeds with 0 warnings, 0 errors

**Risk:** LOW

---

## Phase 7: Documentation Updates (NO RISK)

### Stage 7.1: Audit SCREENS.md Quick Reference - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Verify screen reference documentation is accurate

**Completed:**
1. Added missing navigators: SettingsMenuNavigator, OverlayNavigator, BoosterOpenNavigator, PreBattleNavigator
2. Updated zone navigation shortcuts (added battlefield B/A/R, info shortcuts T/L/V/D)
3. Added detailed battlefield row navigation documentation
4. Verified all shortcut mappings match CLAUDE.md master list

**Risk:** NONE

---

### Stage 7.2: Audit MOD_STRUCTURE.md Implementation Status - COMPLETE
**Scope:** Verify all status markers and file listings are accurate

**Completed:**
1. Updated Screen Navigators section with accurate status markers
2. Added missing files: DebugConfig.cs, DropdownStateManager.cs, CardModelProvider.cs, BattlefieldNavigator.cs
3. Added new navigators: PreBattleNavigator, BoosterOpenNavigator, NPERewardNavigator
4. Moved deprecated navigators to comments (WelcomeGateNavigator, etc.)
5. Added archive/ and installer/ folders to project layout

**Risk:** NONE

---

### Stage 7.3: Update BEST_PRACTICES.md - COMPLETE
**Completed:**
- Added DebugConfig section with usage patterns and available flags
- Added Dropdown Handling section with DropdownStateManager API
- Added reference to DROPDOWN_HANDLING.md for detailed docs
- MenuDebugHelper already documented (GetFullPath, GetGameObjectPath)

**Dependencies:** Phases 2, 4, 5

---

### Stage 7.4: Update MOD_STRUCTURE.md File Listings - COMPLETE
**Completed:** (Combined with Stage 7.2)
- Added DebugConfig.cs, DropdownStateManager.cs to file listing
- Added archive/ and installer/ folders to project layout
- Updated all file references to match current codebase

**Dependencies:** Stage 7.2, all previous phases

---

### Stage 7.5: Create CONTRIBUTING.md (Optional) - SKIPPED
**Decision:** Skipped - would overlap with BEST_PRACTICES.md which already covers:
- Code style guidelines (UI Interaction Patterns, CustomButton Pattern)
- Debug logging conventions (DebugConfig section)
- How to add new features (Adding Support for New Screens)

**Future consideration:** If BEST_PRACTICES.md grows unwieldy, consider reorganizing it rather than creating a separate CONTRIBUTING.md
