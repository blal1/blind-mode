# Element Grouping Feature Plan

## Goal
Break long menu lists into smaller, contextual groups for better blind user navigation. Instead of navigating 20-40+ elements linearly, users navigate a hierarchy: groups → elements within groups.

**Secondary goal:** Simplify the existing complex filtering architecture by consolidating multiple filtering layers into a unified grouping model.

---

## Current Status

### Completed (Phase 1-4)

- **Infrastructure Created:**
  - `ElementGroup.cs` - Group enum with overlay groups
  - `OverlayDetector.cs` - Simplified overlay detection
  - `ElementGroupAssigner.cs` - Parent pattern matching for group assignment
  - `GroupedNavigator.cs` - Two-level hierarchical navigation with folder support

- **Integration Completed:**
  - OverlayDetector integrated into GeneralMenuNavigator for ShouldShowElement and HandleBackNavigation
  - ElementGroupAssigner integrated into DiscoverElements()
  - GroupedNavigator navigation overrides (MoveNext, MovePrevious, MoveFirst, MoveLast)
  - HandleGroupedEnter and HandleGroupedBackspace for Enter/Backspace handling

- **Features Implemented:**
  - Hierarchical navigation (groups → elements)
  - Folder-based grouping for Decks screen (each folder becomes its own group)
  - Folder toggle activation through normal element path (triggers rescan properly)
  - Pending folder entry mechanism (preserves navigation across rescans)
  - Auto-deactivate folder toggle when exiting folder group
  - Primary elements as standalone items at group level (directly activatable)
  - Auto-enter only when exactly 1 group exists
  - Content group always available (even when folders have decks)
  - Objectives subgroup within Progress with full text extraction (quests show description + progress + reward)
  - Progress indicators show type + progress (e.g., "Daily: 0/15 wins, 250 gold")

### Decisions Made/Changed

| Decision | Original | Current |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Secondary group | Planned | **Removed** - elements fall to Content or Navigation |
| Primary group | Auto-enter first | **Standalone items** - shown directly at group level, not inside a group |
| Content group | Grouped together | **Standalone items** - each element shown directly at group level (like Primary) |
| Auto-enter | Primary + single-item groups | **Only when 1 total group** exists |
| Single-element groups | Created as groups | **Standalone** - groups with exactly 1 element become standalone items |
| ForegroundLayer | Remove entirely | **Kept for now** - still used for ContentPanel/Home filtering |
| Folder grouping | Not planned | **Added** - Decks screen folders become their own groups |
| Content with folders | Skip Content group | **Always show** - Content has filters/buttons even when inside folders |

## Current Behavior

### Home Screen Navigation
1. Enter screen: "Home. X groups. Play, X items." (Play group with all play-related elements)
2. Press Enter: "1 of X. Play, button."
3. Navigate: Direct Challenge, Rankings, Events inside the group
4. Press Backspace: "Play, X items." (back to group level)
5. Press Arrow Down: "Progress, X items." (Mastery, Gems, Wildcards, Objectives subgroup)
6. Enter Progress, navigate to "Objectives, X items", press Enter to see quests
7. Backspace from Objectives returns to Progress group

### Decks Screen Navigation
1. Enter screen: "Decks. 4 groups. Filters, 2 items."
2. Navigate to folder: "Meine Decks, 0 items." (folder with collapsed decks)
3. Press Enter:
   - Toggle activated through normal element path (triggers rescan)
   - Pending folder entry set
   - After rescan: auto-enters folder with discovered decks
   - "1 of 10. Deck Name, deck."
4. Navigate within folder: Left/Right arrows
5. Press Backspace:
   - Folder toggle deactivated
   - "Meine Decks, X items." (back to group level)
6. Content group available: dropdowns, color filters, buttons accessible

### Folder Entry Flow (Technical)
1. `HandleGroupedEnter()` detects folder group
2. Finds folder toggle in `_elements` list
3. Calls `ActivateCurrentElement()` → `OnElementActivated()` → `TriggerRescan()`
4. Calls `EnterGroup()` which sets `_pendingFolderEntry = folderName`
5. Rescan runs `OrganizeIntoGroups()`
6. `OrganizeIntoGroups()` checks `_pendingFolderEntry`, auto-enters folder
7. User is inside folder with decks visible

### Group State Restoration (January 2026)

When UI changes trigger a rescan (e.g., page navigation in collection), the group navigation state needs to be preserved so the user doesn't get kicked back to the group list.

**Problem:** `OrganizeIntoGroups()` resets `_currentGroupIndex = -1` and rebuilds all groups. User loses their position.

**Solution:** `SaveCurrentGroupForRestore()` / restore logic in `OrganizeIntoGroups()`:

1. Before rescan: `PerformRescan()` calls `_groupedNavigator.SaveCurrentGroupForRestore()`
2. Saves: current `ElementGroup` type and `NavigationLevel` (GroupList vs InsideGroup)
3. After groups rebuilt: `OrganizeIntoGroups()` finds matching group by type and restores position
4. If group no longer exists: falls back to first group

**Key Fields:**
- `_pendingGroupRestore` - ElementGroup to restore
- `_pendingLevelRestore` - NavigationLevel to restore
- `_pendingElementIndexRestore` - Element index within group to restore

**Used by:**
- Page Up/Down in collection - changes page without losing position in Collection group
- Deck builder card activation - preserves position when adding/removing cards
- Any rescan that should preserve user's current group context

**PlayBlade Exception:**
Group restore is **skipped in PlayBlade context** to prevent interference with the auto-entry system. PlayBlade uses its own navigation flow via `_pendingPlayBladeTabsEntry`, `_pendingPlayBladeContentEntry`, etc. If group restore ran in PlayBlade, it would overwrite these auto-entries with stale state.

### Subgroups (Nested Groups)

Some groups are nested within other groups for better organization. Currently:
- **Objectives** is a subgroup within **Progress**

**Objectives Subgroup Contents (7 items typical):**
- 3 Quests - shown with description + progress + reward (e.g., "Cast 20 spells, 14/20, 500 gold")
- Daily - shown with wins progress + gold reward (e.g., "Daily: 0/15 wins, 250 gold")
- Weekly - shown with wins progress (e.g., "Weekly: 5/15")
- Battle Pass Level - shown with level + EP progress (e.g., "Battle Pass Level: 7, 400/1000 EP")
- Spark Rank - shown with progress (e.g., "Spark Rank: 0/1")

**Text Extraction:** `UITextExtractor.TryGetObjectiveText()` extracts full info from objective elements:
- For quests: finds TextLine (description), Text_GoalProgress (progress), Circle (reward)
- For progress bars: extracts type from parent name + progress from Text_GoalProgress

**Subgroup Navigation Flow:**
1. Navigate to Progress group
2. Enter Progress - see elements like Mastery, Gems, Wildcards, and "Objectives, 7 items"
3. Navigate to "Objectives, 7 items" entry
4. Press Enter - enter the Objectives subgroup, see individual objectives
5. Navigate through objectives with Up/Down arrows
6. Press Backspace - return to Progress group (not to group list)
7. Press Backspace again - exit to group list

**Technical Implementation:**
- `GroupedElement.SubgroupType` field marks an element as a subgroup entry (no physical GameObject)
- `_subgroupElements` dictionary stores subgroup elements separately
- `_currentSubgroup` tracks when inside a subgroup
- `EnterSubgroup()` / `ExitSubgroup()` handle navigation
- `GetCurrentElementCount()` and `GetCurrentElement()` return subgroup data when inside a subgroup

**Adding New Subgroups:**
1. Create the ElementGroup enum value (e.g., `ElementGroup.NewSubgroup`)
2. Add assignment logic in `ElementGroupAssigner.DetermineGroup()`
3. In `GroupedNavigator.OrganizeIntoGroups()`:
   - Extract subgroup elements into `_subgroupElements`
   - Add a subgroup entry element to the parent group with `SubgroupType` set
4. The navigation logic (enter/exit/backspace) handles it automatically

### 2D Sub-Navigation (Virtual Elements with Entry Navigation)

Some groups need richer navigation than the standard group/element hierarchy. The **2D sub-navigation** pattern provides a grid-like experience: Up/Down switches between rows (elements in the group), Left/Right navigates individual entries within each row.

**Currently used by:** `DeckBuilderInfo` group (deck statistics)

**How it works:**
- The group contains virtual elements (GameObject=null) representing rows
- Each row has a list of individual text entries
- Standard GroupedNavigator handles row switching (elements = rows)
- GeneralMenuNavigator intercepts input when inside the group to provide entry-level navigation

**DeckBuilderInfo Example:**
1. Tab to "Deck Info" group
2. Enter → "Cards. 35 von 60" (first row, first entry)
3. Right → "20 Creatures (56%)" (next entry in Cards row)
4. Right → "12 Others (33%)"
5. Down → "Mana Curve. 1 or less: 4" (second row, first entry)
6. Right → "2: 8" (next mana cost entry)
7. Home → "1 or less: 4" (first entry in current row)
8. Tab → cycles to next deck builder group (Collection, Deck List, etc.)

**Difference from Subgroups:**
- **Subgroups** (e.g., Objectives inside Progress) are a third navigation level. Enter on a subgroup entry dives into it; Backspace exits back to the parent group. Subgroups contain full GroupedElements with GameObjects.
- **2D sub-navigation** stays at the InsideGroup level. Left/Right navigates within a row; Up/Down switches rows. No additional Enter is needed. Entries are pure text strings, not GroupedElements.

**When to use which:**
- Use **subgroups** when entries are interactive UI elements that need activation (clicks, toggles)
- Use **2D sub-navigation** when entries are informational text that just needs to be read/announced

**Implementation Pattern (for reuse):**

1. **Data provider** - Create a method returning `List<(string label, List<string> entries)>` where each tuple is one row with its sub-entries. Example: `DeckInfoProvider.GetDeckInfoRows()`

2. **State fields in navigator** - Add cached row data and current entry index:
   ```csharp
   private List<(string label, List<string> entries)> _myRows;
   private int _myEntryIndex;
   ```

3. **Activation check** - Method to detect if sub-navigation is active:
   ```csharp
   private bool IsMySubNavActive()
   {
       return _groupedNavigator.Level == NavigationLevel.InsideGroup
           && _groupedNavigator.CurrentGroup?.Group == ElementGroup.MyGroup
           && _myRows != null && _myRows.Count > 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Intercept navigation** - In MoveNext/MovePrevious overrides, skip when Tab is pressed (let Tab cycling handle group switches), otherwise reset entry index and announce:
   ```csharp
   if (IsMySubNavActive() && !Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Tab))
   {
       bool moved = _groupedNavigator.MoveNext(); // row switch
       if (moved) { _myEntryIndex = 0; AnnounceEntry(includeRowName: true); }
       return;
   }
   ```

5. **Handle Left/Right** - In HandleCustomInput, before other Left/Right handlers, navigate entries within the current row.

6. **Initialize on entry** - When the group is entered (HandleGroupedEnter or Tab cycling into it), load the row data and set entry index to 0.

7. **Clear on exit** - Set row data to null when exiting (Backspace or Tab cycling away).

### Overlay Handling
- Popup dialogs suppress all other groups
- Settings menu handled by SettingsMenuNavigator
- Play blade shows only PlayBlade group elements
- Social panel shows only Social group elements

### PlayBlade Navigation (via PlayBladeNavigationHelper)

The PlayBlade has a custom navigation hierarchy handled by `PlayBladeNavigationHelper`:

**Groups in PlayBlade:**
- `PlayBladeTabs` (display: "Tabs") - Events, Find Match, Recent tabs
- `PlayBladeContent` (display: "Play Options") - Ranked, Play, Brawl mode selectors
- `PlayBladeFolders` (display: "Folders") - Container showing all deck folders as selectable items
- Folder groups - Meine Decks, Starterdecks (individual deck folder contents)

**Navigation Flow:**
1. PlayBlade opens → auto-enter Tabs group
2. Enter on "Find Match" tab → auto-enter Play Options group (Ranked/Play/Brawl)
3. Enter on "Ranked" mode → auto-enter Folders group (list of all deck folders)
4. Navigate folders: "1 of 2: Meine Decks, 8 decks", "2 of 2: Starterdecks, 15 decks"
5. Enter on "Meine Decks" → enter that folder group, see decks
6. Enter on a deck → deck selected AND match automatically starts (auto-play)
7. Backspace in folder → back to Folders list
8. Backspace in Folders → back to Play Options (Content)
9. Backspace in Content → back to Tabs
10. Backspace in Tabs → close blade

**Auto-Play Feature:**
When a deck is selected in PlayBlade, the Play button is automatically pressed to start the match.
This streamlines the workflow - user just navigates to a deck and presses Enter to play.

**Technical Implementation:**
- `HandleEnter(element, group)` - checks element's group type directly, returns `PlayBladeResult`
- `HandleBackspace()` - checks current group type directly (not `IsPlayBladeContext` flag, which is unreliable due to debounce during blade Hide/Show cycles), returns `PlayBladeResult`
- `PlayBladeResult` enum: `NotHandled`, `Handled`, `RescanNeeded`, `CloseBlade`
- GeneralMenuNavigator calls helper first, then acts on the result
- In PlayBlade context, deck folders are wrapped in a `PlayBladeFolders` group
- `PlayBladeFolders` contains folder toggles as elements; entering uses default folder logic
- `HandleGroupedEnter` in GeneralMenuNavigator detects PlayBladeFolders context and enters the corresponding folder GROUP
- Outside PlayBlade (Decks screen), folders remain as individual groups at top level

**PlayBlade group detection caveat:**
Elements are classified as PlayBlade groups by `IsInsidePlayBlade()` in `ElementGroupAssigner`, which matches broad parent path patterns (`Blade_`, `BladeContent`, `BladeContainer`, etc.). Deeper pages rendered inside the blade (deck selection, deck builder header) are excluded by name. If new UI is added inside the blade hierarchy without exclusions, it could be misclassified as PlayBladeContent and receive PlayBlade backspace handling. Check `ElementGroupAssigner.IsInsidePlayBlade()` and its exclusion list if unexpected navigation behavior occurs in screens that render inside the blade.

**Why special handling needed:**
- Tab clicks cause rapid blade Hide/Show events that would reset normal state tracking
- Mode selection (Ranked/Play/Brawl) doesn't trigger panel changes, so manual rescan needed
- Backspace behavior differs from normal groups (hierarchical: folder→folders→content→tabs→close)
- Folder groups need to be presented as a list in PlayBlade, not as individual top-level groups
- Group restore must be skipped when PlayBlade auto-entries run (tracked via `playBladeAutoEntryPerformed` flag)

**Blade Close/Open Cycles:**
When activating a tab (e.g., "Find Match"), the blade briefly closes and reopens. During this:
1. `RequestPlayBladeContentEntry()` sets `_pendingPlayBladeContentEntry = true`
2. Blade closes → `SetPlayBladeContext(false)` clears group restore state but **preserves auto-entry flags**
3. Blade reopens → auto-entry flag is still set
4. After rescan → user is auto-entered into Content group as intended

The auto-entry flags (`_pendingPlayBladeContentEntry`, `_pendingFoldersEntry`, etc.) are intentionally NOT cleared on blade close to support this workflow.

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Screen-Specific Tuning (MOSTLY COMPLETE)

**Home Screen:**
- [x] Play group containing Play button, Direct Challenge, Rankings, Events
- [x] Navigation group (navbar items)
- [x] Content group (carousel, other items)
- [ ] Review if any elements are misclassified

**Decks Screen:**
- [x] Folder-based grouping
- [x] Auto-toggle folder checkboxes on enter
- [x] Auto-deactivate folder toggle on exit (backspace)
- [x] Pending folder entry (preserves state across rescan)
- [x] Content group always available (filters, dropdowns, buttons)
- [x] Test with multiple folders
- [x] Color filters classified as Filters (added DeckColorFilters pattern)

**Collection Screen:**
- [ ] Tune mana color filters
- [ ] Card grid content grouping
- [ ] Test filter interactions

**Store Screen:**
- [ ] Review store content grouping
- [ ] Test pack/bundle navigation

### Phase 5: Code Cleanup

**Remove unused code from GeneralMenuNavigator:**
- [ ] `IsChildOfSocialPanel()` - now handled by OverlayDetector
- [ ] `IsInsideNPEOverlay()` - now handled by OverlayDetector
- [ ] `IsInsideBlade()` - still used in ContentPanel filtering, review if can remove
- [ ] `IsMainButton()` - still used in ContentPanel filtering, review if can remove

**Note:** ForegroundLayer and `GetCurrentForeground()` are still needed for:
- ContentPanel filtering (Collection, Store, etc.)
- Home filtering (show only home content + navbar)

These can potentially be replaced with group-based filtering later, but require careful testing.

### Phase 6: Polish & Testing

- [ ] Update F1 help with group navigation instructions
- [ ] Test all overlay cases (popup, social, play blade, settings)
- [ ] Test screen transitions
- [ ] Test popup from Settings (layered overlays)
- [ ] Performance testing with many elements

---

## Critical Testing Checklist

### Overlay Suppression
- [x] Play blade suppresses other groups
- [x] Social panel suppresses other groups (F4 toggle)
- [x] Popup dialogs suppress other groups
- [x] Settings menu handled by SettingsMenuNavigator
- [ ] Nested overlays (popup over settings)

### Group Navigation
- [x] Arrow Up/Down navigates groups at group level
- [x] Arrow Up/Down navigates elements inside group
- [x] Enter on standalone element activates directly
- [x] Enter on normal group enters it
- [x] Backspace from inside group exits to group level
- [x] Backspace from group level does normal back navigation
- [x] Home/End work at both levels

### Folder Groups (Decks)
- [x] Folders become separate groups
- [x] Empty folders shown (toggle found, 0 decks until activated)
- [x] Entering folder group activates folder checkbox
- [x] Rescan discovers newly visible decks
- [x] Pending folder entry preserves navigation across rescan
- [x] Exiting folder group deactivates folder checkbox
- [x] Deck elements properly grouped by folder
- [x] Content group available while in folder view

### Screen-Specific
- [x] Home: Play group (Play button, Direct Challenge, Rankings, Events)
- [x] Home: Navigation and Content groups
- [x] Decks: Folder grouping with toggle activation
- [x] Decks: Content group with filters/buttons
- [x] Deck Builder: DeckBuilderInfo group with 2D sub-navigation (card count, types, mana curve)
- [x] Deck Builder: Card count announced on add/remove
- [ ] Collection: Card filters work
- [ ] Store: Content properly grouped

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **ForegroundLayer still needed** - ContentPanel and Home filtering still use the old ForegroundLayer system. Full removal requires more work to handle these cases with group-based filtering.

2. **Secondary group removed** - Elements that would have been Secondary now fall to Content or Navigation. May need to revisit if this causes issues.

3. **Auto-enter behavior** - Only triggers when exactly 1 group. Standalone elements at group level are directly activatable.

4. **Single-element groups** - Non-folder groups with exactly 1 element become standalone (shown directly at group level). Folder groups always remain groups regardless of element count (0 elements allowed for collapsed folders, 1+ elements keep folder context and exit behavior).

5. ~~**Color filters classification**~~ - Fixed: Added `DeckColorFilters` pattern to `IsFilterElement()`.

6. ~~**Folder toggle on already-visible folder**~~ - Fixed: Now checks `toggle.isOn` before activating. Entering an already-visible folder no longer toggles it off.

7. **NPE overlay exclusion** - `Objective_NPE` elements (like Spark Rank) are excluded from NPE overlay classification so they can be grouped with Objectives. This might affect NPE tutorial screens if any tutorial elements have "Objective_NPE" in their path. See KNOWN_ISSUES.md for details.

8. **Deck list quantity button exclusion** - `CustomButton - Tag` elements (showing "4x", "2x" quantities) must be excluded in `DetermineGroup()` directly, NOT in `DetermineOverlayGroup()`. Returning `Unknown` from `DetermineOverlayGroup()` just means "not an overlay" and causes the element to fall through to Content group. The exclusion check must happen before the final `return ElementGroup.Content` in `DetermineGroup()`.

---

## Success Criteria

1. [x] Overlay cases work (popup, social, play blade)
2. [x] Hierarchical navigation works (groups → elements)
3. [x] Folder grouping works on Decks screen
4. [x] Folder toggle activation triggers proper rescan
5. [x] Pending folder entry preserves state across rescan
6. [x] Content group always available (even with folders)
7. [x] Primary elements are standalone and directly activatable
8. [ ] All main screens properly grouped (Home, Decks, Collection, Store)
9. [ ] No regressions in existing navigation
10. [ ] Code simplified (IsChildOf methods removed where possible)
